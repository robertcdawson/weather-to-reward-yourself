## Weather to Reward Yourself

#### Description

This React app uses the [Yahoo Weather API](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/) to show weather conditions for a submitted zip code and provide activity recommendations based on those conditions.

Rainy and cold? Hot chocolate and a good book.

Sunny and warm? Ice cream!

You get the idea. This is not about what to wear. We're not idiots. This is about what to do, you know, before global warming kills us all.

I'll probably never finish the recommendations part but you can be sure that what I do recommend will improve your life immeasurably.

Enjoy!
